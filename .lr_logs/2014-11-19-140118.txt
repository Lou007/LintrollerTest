FINAL RESULTS:
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:12:  [5] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar: 
  Requires maximum length in CHARACTERS, not bytes (CWE-120). Risk is high, 
  it appears that the size is given as bytes, but the function requires size 
  as characters. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/returns3.cpp:11:  [5.0] (race) chmod: 
  his accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a race 
  condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/returns2.cpp:10:  [4.0] (shell) system: 
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely 
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality 
  if available. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/returns3.cpp:10:  [4.0] (shell) system: 
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely 
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality 
  if available. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:6:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:7:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:10:  [1.0] (buffer) strlen: 
  Does not handle strings that are not \\0-terminated; if given one it may 
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:14:  [1] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar: 
  Requires maximum length in CHARACTERS, not bytes (CWE-120). Risk is very 
  low, the length appears to be in characters not bytes.
