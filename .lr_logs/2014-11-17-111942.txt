/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:17:  [5] (buffer) strncat: 
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum 
  size to add) (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, or automatically 
  resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter appears to be a 
  constant, instead of computing the number of characters left. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:18:  [5] (buffer) _tcsncat: 
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum 
  size to add) (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, or automatically 
  resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter appears to be a 
  constant, instead of computing the number of characters left. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:21:  [5] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar: 
  Requires maximum length in CHARACTERS, not bytes (CWE-120). Risk is high, 
  it appears that the size is given as bytes, but the function requires size 
  as characters. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:10:  [4.0] (buffer) _mbscpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using a function version that stops copying at the end of the 
  buffer. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:13:  [4.0] (buffer) lstrcat: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination 
  (CWE-120). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:18:  [4.0] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily 
  misused). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:24:  [4.0] (buffer) sprintf: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or 
  vsnprintf. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:32:  [4.0] (format) snprintf: 
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be + 
  exploited, and note that sprintf variations do not always \\0-terminate 
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:33:  [4.0] (shell) popen: 
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely 
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality 
  if available. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:42:  [4.0] (format) printf: 
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited 
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/junk.c:7:  [4.0] (buffer) fscanf: 
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits 
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a 
  different input function. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/junk.c:9:  [4.0] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).

  misused). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:22:  [3.0] (buffer) getenv: 
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an 
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can 
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:24:  [3.0] (buffer) getenv:

  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20).

  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds

/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:11:  [2.0] (buffer) memcpy:

/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:14:  [1.0] (buffer) strncpy: 
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \\0-terminate or + check for 
  invalid pointers (CWE-120).

/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:19:  [1.0] (buffer) strlen: 
  Does not handle strings that are not \\0-terminated; if given one it may 
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest.c:23:  [1] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar: 
  Requires maximum length in CHARACTERS, not bytes (CWE-120). Risk is very 
  low, the length appears to be in characters not bytes. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:28:  [1] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily 
  misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant character.
