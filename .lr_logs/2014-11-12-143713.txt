/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:18:  [4.0] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily 
  misused). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:24:  [4.0] (buffer) sprintf: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or 
  vsnprintf. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:32:  [4.0] (format) snprintf: 
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be + 
  exploited, and note that sprintf variations do not always \\0-terminate 
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:33:  [4.0] (shell) popen: 
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely 
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality 
  if available. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:42:  [4.0] (format) printf: 
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited 
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/junk.c:7:  [4.0] (buffer) fscanf: 
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits 
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a 
  different input function. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/junk.c:9:  [4.0] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily 
  misused). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:22:  [3.0] (buffer) getenv: 
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an 
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can 
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:24:  [3.0] (buffer) getenv: 
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an 
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can 
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:10:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:11:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:12:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/junk.c:5:  [2.0] (buffer) char: 
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, + leading to 
  potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds 
  checking, use functions that limit length, + or ensure that the size is 
  larger than the maximum possible length. 
/home/lou/Desktop/FinalTest/TestDocs/flawtest1.cpp:28:  [1] (buffer) strcpy: 
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). 
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily 
  misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant character.
